# STARGATE Tik-Tok App

## To start this app:
### `npm i`
This will install the packages you need

### fill out the `.env` file
Fill this out by signing up to [DataStax](www.datastax.com) and getting the information you need as per the `.env.sample` template.

### `netlify dev`
This will run as if you deployed your app onto Netlify (but in dev mode). It will also use your .env content.


# This Repo is to aid in the tutorial in [How to build a Tik-Tok App with a Cassandra Database](https://youtu.be/IATOicvih5A)

We build an App using the same database management system used by Apple, Spotify, Netflix, Ebay and so many more.

This is a video where we will build a clone of a Tik Tok App. It's aim is to teach you how to build apps using databases in a simple and easy way. A prior knowledge of React is the only thing you will be needing to start this tutorial!

### I have built this app using:
- Stargate documentation (https://stargate.io/) 
- DataStax https://www.datastax.com/
- React 
- Netlify
(JAMStack)
