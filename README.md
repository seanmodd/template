## Sean Modd TikTok and (Updated) Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository containing the code for my personal portfolio! I built this as a means of expanding my knowledge of React.js, using a brand new component library: Chakra UI! You can view this site to gain a better understanding of some of my work experience and accomplishments.

### Running Locally

```
$ git clone https://github.com/seanmodd/mytiktok.git
$ cd updated-portfolio
```

Install npm packages

```
npm i
```

Start up Next.js server and navigate to `localhost:3000`

```
npm run dev
```

### Motivation

- Redevelop my portfolio now that I've got about a year of experience under my belt
- Learn a new component framework (Chakra UI)
- Gain a better understanding of Next.js and the features it provides out-of-the-box
- Improve my previous design and site content

### Technologies Used

- React.js as a front-end framework
- JavaScript as an implementation language
- Chakra UI for configurable, out-of-the-box React.js components
- Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and more
- Visual Studio Code as in the integrated development environment
